 * IMX708 video recording over USB serial, for the Waveshare ESP32-P4-WIFI6.
 *
 * Streams the IMX708 as YUV420, encodes it with the P4's hardware H.264 core,
 * buffers the whole clip in PSRAM, and then sends it down the console UART in
 * one framed payload - the same transport imx708_snapshot uses for stills.
 * tools/capture.py picks it up and muxes it into a .mp4 you can double-click.
 *
 * Why H.264 rather than a burst of JPEGs. For a single still, H.264 is the
 * wrong tool: an I-frame is roughly a JPEG with extra ceremony and no size win,
 * which is why the snapshot example sends JPEG. For a sequence, temporal
 * prediction is the entire point. A 1080p JPEG off this sensor is ~250 KB, so
 * 28 fps of them is ~7 MB/s; the same scene as H.264 at 4 Mbit/s is 500 KB/s,
 * fourteen times smaller, and most of that saving is frames that barely change.
 *
 * Why record first and send afterwards, rather than streaming as it encodes.
 * The console is 2 Mbaud - about 200 KB/s - which is well under any 1080p
 * bitrate worth recording. Streaming live would force the bitrate down to fit
 * the cable and make picture quality a property of the UART. Recording into
 * PSRAM decouples them completely: the encoder runs at whatever bitrate suits
 * the picture, the link only decides how long you wait afterwards. The cost is
 * that clip length is bounded by REC_BUF_BYTES rather than by patience.
